# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Moved forwards with "BDD in Action" book, mostly working on exercise 2.1

**Thoughts:** 
  Although I picked book for learning more about BDD, it is very Java oriented and the code is a bit dated (normal for book of it's age). So far biggest challenge is not understanding BDD, but getting used to Java ecosystem.

### Day 3: December 29, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished exercise, cheating a bit by copying pieces of reference implementation. 

**Thoughts:** 
  I have always understood *why* of BDD, but strugling more with *how*. Hope this exercise will help. I will try to religiously use both(?) TDD/BDD in a "play" project of mine.
  Curious about how well BDD applies in single-person projects.
