# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Moved forwards with "BDD in Action" book, mostly working on exercise 2.1

**Thoughts:** 
  Although I picked book for learning more about BDD, it is very Java oriented and the code is a bit dated (normal for book of it's age). So far biggest challenge is not understanding BDD, but getting used to Java ecosystem.

### Day 2: December 29, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished exercise, cheating a bit by copying pieces of reference implementation. Kept reading till exercise 3.1 and decided it's a good point where to stop.

**Thoughts:** 
  I have always understood *why* of BDD, but strugling more with *how*. Hope this exercise will help. I will try to religiously use both(?) TDD/BDD in a "play" project of mine.
  Curious about how well BDD applies in single-person projects.
  Figure 3.3 is worth keeping at hand.
  
### Day 3: December 30, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Kept going through the book, got all the way up to chapter 4.

**Thoughts:** 
  Having vision and business goals helps with prioritizing and discovering implied requirements.
  The 5 whys is a extremaly useful technique to get the requirements and reasoning. I should definitely do that more (and encourage team mates to do the same).
  Impact map - mind map (why/who/how/what), starts with business goal.
  The chapter on understanding business goals seems to be slight waste of time, as I don't expect to be able to use those techniques soon. Still a good refresher and at least some of ideas I should be able to apply at least partially.

**Exercise 3.1** The goal is to make sure that there are no erroneous subsidy payments. 

### Day 4: December 31, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Kept going through the book, got all the way up to chapter 5.

**Thoughts:** 
  We too often decompose features into stories based on technical implementation, instead of what value are stories delivering.
  Chapter 4 feels more like something I would be able to use in my day-to-day job.
  I should use story review/estimation sessions as a vehicle for discussions more often.
